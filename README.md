# GitCoin

Because Github needs cybermoney, y'all!


## Usage

The file `users.txt` tracks what users own GitCoins and how many of them they have. If you wish to make a transaction, add the required amount to your account and subtract it from others. This is entirely based on honesty so double check your maths.

To get started you need coin. We have an ICO, send bitcoin.
